# Test rig

`tools/rig/rig.py` runs the reference or our program with scripted gamepad input, a time limit, a memory limit and a read-only game directory. Everything a run produces goes to `analysis/rig/runs/<stamp>-<target>-<scenario>/`, and nothing there is committed.

```
tools/rig/rig.py setup                              # once: download and check the reference
tools/rig/rig.py run reference new-game-to-clinic   # the reference run
tools/rig/rig.py run bb-run --time 120              # our program, same limits, no input yet
```

A run writes `target.log`, `events.csv` (what the rig did, tied to places in the log), `frames.csv` (one line per present), `memory.csv` (`peak_program_bytes` in the summary leaves out the page cache of the game's files), `shots/*.png`, `kernel.log` and `summary.json`. The exit status is 0 when the scenario finished with no kernel GPU fault and an unchanged game directory.

Scenario steps are documented at the top of `tools/rig/scenario.py`, and scenarios live in `tools/rig/scenarios/`.

## Decisions

**A small Vulkan layer instead of MangoHud and desktop screenshots.** The layer (`tools/rig/layer/`) timestamps every `vkQueuePresentKHR` and copies the presented image on request. It works the same for any program that presents through Vulkan, so the reference and `bb-run` are measured in the same way once ours draws. It needs no window focus and takes a picture in milliseconds, where `spectacle` took up to 20 s and needed the active window. MangoHud is not used: it wrote no CSV in two runs, and picture conditions need the grabs anyway.

**Waits follow the game, not the clock.** Scenarios wait for log lines of the target (the game's file opens and system calls that shadPS4 logs) or for picture conditions on a small grey copy of the frame. Fixed sleeps remain only for menu input pacing. The log markers come from the reference, so a scenario for `bb-run` may need its own once our log differs.

**A captured frame is marked, not hidden.** A capture waits inside the present call, so `frames.csv` flags that frame and the statistics leave out the intervals around it.

**At most one picture a second.** With captures every 0.25 to 4 seconds the reference crashed around the end of the opening video in 4 of 13 runs (faults in guest memory and in emulator threads, no GPU fault). With few or no captures it was 0 of 16, and limited to one picture a second it was 5 of 5 clean. This is a correlation and the cause is not settled. A crash in the reference still ends a run with a non-zero exit status, so a failed run is visible.

**Fresh data directory per run, on purpose.** The reference uses `work/user/` inside the run directory (portable mode). A new game therefore never meets an old save. `--user-from` copies an earlier `user/` for runs that need one.

**A zenity stub answers dialogs.** On an empty data directory shadPS4 asks through SDL and zenity whether to migrate saves, and blocks until someone answers. The rig puts a stub first in `PATH` that answers "Do nothing" and logs the call to `zenity-calls.txt`. A stub that only fails makes SDL fall back to an X11 message box, which blocks in the same way.

**`bb-run` runs headless for now.** It has no picture and no pad yet, so it gets the same limits, logging and checks and no input. Its XDG directories are per run and outside the checkout, because it refuses runtime directories inside the source tree. When it presents frames, passing `--window` is all it takes to get the same frame times and pictures.
